# ABOUT ME

I am 20 years old. Studied **Chinese Language and Literature** for one year at **Erciyes University**, at second grade, I tried to study again to go to some branch that involves computers such as software programming but I didn't get a good score so I chose to study **English Translation and Interpreting** at **KÄ±rklareli University**, am at the first grade this year. On 2020 July, I started working at **Next Geography** as **Software Developer**. I have been engaged in computers since high school. I have been improving myself at fields like Linux system management, web design and programming, back-end programming. Currently I am using these programming languages/technologies; **Python, JavaScript(ECMAScript 6-7), React, Django, Node.JS, MongoDB, Docker, Git**. While programming, I pay too much attention to things like speed, performance and aesthetics. I also have some interest in cyber security, building a safe system is my objective.
