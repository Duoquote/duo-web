# ABOUT ME

I am 20 years old, although I was in language class in high school I am currently studying at **Erciyes University Chinese Language and Literature** 2nd year but this year I am studying  for university exams again to go to **Software Engineering** but Computer Engineering is an option too. I have been working with computers since middle school. I am constantly trying to learn new things about; **software, Linux system administration, designing web ui, cyber security, efficiency/speed on back-end and front-end and computer technologies etc. My goal is to build systems that are; secure, efficient, fast and if needed, aesthetically pleasing.** The reason I am into cyber security is to observe from attacker side to build systems that are invulnerable to cyber attacks.
