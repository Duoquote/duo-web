# duo-web â€” My Personal Website

My new website written in node.js using express and webpack.

### List of all incredible technologies that I used:
| Tech | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | There is no need to describe the purpose of using it, it just is useful as is. |
| Express | I guess it is the easiest way to run a web server |
| Webpack | Everything in this code base is mostly based on this thing. It makes the code so small that the website scores go insane. |
| Pug | It makes pages incredibly customizable, everything in html file is filled with this thing. |
| Bootstrap | It makes creating beautiful websites much easier. |
| Scss/Sass | Sure bootstrap itself is not enough for me, all css is written with scss. |
| Babel | I only used it's `polyfill` feature to support a few old browsers. |
| Anime.js | For cool load animation and smooth page change animations. Before that I tried myself but it was not very efficient so I decided to use anime.js instead. |
| Markdown | To make changes to website easier, I used this, I applied only specific parts of it. |
| Sentry | I don't know why but I added it as it would send me notifications when an error occurs. |
| Lodash | I used that to easily and efficiently swap between languages. |


### Customizability

I tried to write the website easily customizable and probably it is but I currently have no time explaining how to do that.
